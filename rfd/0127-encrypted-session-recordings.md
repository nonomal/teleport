# RFD 127 - Encrypted Session Recordings

## Required Approvers

- Engineering: @rosstimothy, @zmb3, @espadolini, @nklaassen
- Security: doyensec

## What

This document proposes an approach to encrypting session recording data before
writing to disk or any long term storage.

## Why

Recordings temporarily stored to disk can be easily tampered with by users with
enough access. This could even occur within the session being recorded if the
host user has root access.

Encrypting session recordings at rest can help prevent exposure of credentials
or other secrets that might be visible within the recording.

## Details

This document should fulfill the following requirements:

- Ability to encrypt session recording data at rest in long term storage and
  during any intermediate disk writes.
- Ability to replay encrypted sessions using the web UI.
- Ability to guard decryption using key material from an HSM or other supported
  keystore.
- Support for multiple auth servers using different HSM/KMS backends.
- An encryption algorithm suitable for this workload.

### Encryption Algorithm

This RFD assumes the usage of [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age), which
was chosen for its provenance, simplicity, and focus on strong cryptography
defaults without requiring customization. The formal spec can be found
[here](https://age-encryption.org/v1). Officially supported key algorithms are
limited to X25519 (recommended by the spec), Ed25519, and RSA. Support for
other algorithms would either have to be requested from the upstream or
manually implemented as a custom plugin. The algorithms employed by `age` are
not currently compatible with FIPS, which means configuring encrypted sessions
while in FIPS mode will result in failed startup.

Below is a high level diagram showing how `age` encryption and decryption work:

### Config Changes

Encrypted session recording is a feature of the auth service and can be enabled
through the `session_recording_config` resource.

```yaml
# session_recording_config.yml
kind: session_recording_config
version: v2
spec:
  encryption:
    enabled: true
```

HSM integration is facilitated through the existing configuration
options for setting up an HSM backed CA keystore through pkcs#11. Example
configuration found [here](https://goteleport.com/docs/admin-guides/deploy-a-cluster/hsm/#step-25-configure-teleport).

### Session Recording Modes

There are four session recording modes that describe where the recordings are
captured and how they're shipped to long term storage.

- `proxy-sync`
- `proxy`
- `node-sync`
- `node`
  Where the recordings are collected is largely unimportant to the encryption
  strategy, but whether or not they are handled async or sync has different
  requirements.

In sync modes the session recording data is written immediately to the auth
service without intermediate disk writes. The auth service then handles
batching and multipart upload of events to long term storage. In order to
ensure resilience to partial uploads of parts, each batch will need to be
encrypted individually on the auth service. This will likely mean wrapping the
`gzipWriter` [used by slices](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/blob/master/lib/events/stream.go#L669)
with an `age` encryption writer.

In async modes the session recording data is written to intermediate `.part`
files. These files are collected until they're ready for upload and are then
combined into a single `.tar` file. In order to prevent all session recording
data from being lost in the event of an agent crashing, each part will be
encrypted individually much like the encrypted batches in `sync` modes. Because
the data is already encrypted, exploding the final `.tar` file back into events
to be uploaded to the auth service is not possible. Instead the auth service
must accept a binary upload of the `.tar` file which it can then proxy to long
term storage. This will be done using the `UploadEncryptedSessionRecording`
streaming RPC. Each part will then be written to long term storage using ourt
existing multipart upload functionality.

### Protocols

We record sessions for multiple protocols, including ssh, k8s, database
sessions and more. Because this approach encrypts at the point of writing
without modifying the recording structure, the strategy for encryption is
expected to be the same across all protocols.

### Key Types

This design relies on a few different types of keys.

- File keys generated by `age`. These are per-file data keys used during
  symmetric encryption and decryption of recording data.
- `Identity` and `Recipient` keys used by `age` to wrap and unwrap file keys.
  These are software generated, asymmetric `X25519` keypairs.
- `RSA2048` keypairs owned by HSM/KMS keystores. These are used to wrap and
  unwrap `Identity` keys. "Wrapping" in the context of this document refers to
  software OAEP encryption using `RSA2048` public keys and `SHA256` hashes.
  "Unwrapping" refers to OAEP decryption through direct integration with an HSM
  or KMS. Integrating with keystore backends in this way allows for proxy and
  host nodes to use the easily accessible `Recipient` keys during encryption
  instead of requiring access to any of the key material managed by the
  keystores.

The relationships between key types is shown in the diagram below and further
explained throughout the rest of the document.

                      unwrapping age Identities
```

### Key Generation

To simplify integration with different HSM/KMS systems, the keypair used for
data encryption through `age` will be a software generated `X25519` keypair.
For the rest of this section I will refer to the public key as the `Recipient`
and the private key as the `Identity` in keeping with `age` terminology.

The auth server generating the keys will then use the configured CA keystore to
generate an `RSA` keypair used to wrap the `Identity`. Once encrypted, the
`Recipient`, wrapped `Identity`, and wrapping keypair are added as a new entry
to the `recording_encryption.spec.active_keys` list.

`RSA` key generation is already supported for signing use-cases across AWS KMS,
GCP CKM, and PKCS#11. However we will need to add support for calling into
their native decryption functions in order to unwrap `Identity` keys:

- AWS KMS supports setting an algorithm of `RSAES_OAEP_SHA_256` when using the
  `Decrypt` action of the KMS API.
- GCP CKM supports generating keys of type `RSAES_OAEP_2048_SHA256` which can
  be used when calling the `AsymmetricDecrypt` API from their go SDK. Worth
  noting that keys generated for signing can not be used for decryption, so key
  generation with a GCP backend will need to be modified slightly.
- This should be supported by most HSMs through the `CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP` and
  `CKM_SHA256` mechanisms which can be passed to the `C_DecryptInit` function
  exposed by PKCS#11.

In order to collaboratively generate and share the `Identity` and `Recipient`
keys, all auth servers must create a watcher for `Put` events against the
`RecordingEncryption` resource. Modifications to this resource will signal
existing auth servers to investigate whether or not there is work that needs to
be done. For example, when adding a new auth server to an environment, it will
find that there is already an `X25519` keypair configured. It will check if any
active keys are accessible (detailed in the next paragraph) and, in the case
that there are none, generate a new `RSA` wrapping keypair. The new keypair
will be added as an entry to the list of active keys but without a wrapped
`Identity`. Any other auth server with an active key can inspect the new entry,
unwrap their own copy of the `Identity`, and wrap it again using software OAEP
encryption with the entry's public `RSA` key. The re-wrapped `Identity` is then
saved as the wrapped key for the new entry and the newly added auth server will
be able to decrypt sessions.

Each time there is a change to the active keys, the set of public keys will
also be assigned to `session_recording_config.status.encryption_keys` to be
used by nodes throughout the cluster.

When using KMS keystores, auth servers may share access to the same key. In
that case, they will also share the same wrapped key which can be identified by
the key ID. For HSMs integrated over PKCS#11, the auth server's host UUID is
attached to the key ID and will be used to determine access.

In order to avoid unintended automatic deletion, keys provisioned for encrypted
session recording will be tagged with a different label where applicable. This
will prevent older auth servers from deleting this new keytype and allow new
auth servers to identify which keys are no longer in use before deletion.

### Encryption

At a high level, `age` encryption works by generating a per-file symmetric key
used for data encryption. That key is wrapped using an asymmetric keypair and
included in the header section of the encrypted file as a stanza. Plugins
implementing different key algorithms only affect the crypto involved with
wrapping and unwrapping data encryption keys.

In both proxy and node recording modes, the public `X25519` key used for
wrapping `age` data keys will come from
`session_recording_config.status.encryption_keys`. All unique public keys
present will be added as recipients.

### Decryption and Replay

Because decryption will happen in the auth service before streaming to the
client, the UX of replaying encrypted recordings is nearly identical to
unencrypted recordings. The auth server will find and unwrap its active key in
the `recording_encryption` resource using either the key's identifier within
the KMS or the `host_uuid` attached to HSM derived keys. It will use that key
to decrypt the data on the fly as it's streamed back to the client. This should
be compatible with all replay clients, including web. The only change to the
client UX is that encrypted recording files can not be passed directly to
`tsh play` because decryption is only possible within the auth service.

If a recording was encrypted with a rotated key, the auth server will also need
to search the list of rotated keys for the given public key. This list will be
found bylooking up the `rotated_keys` resource keyed by the `age` public key
they relate to.

It's important to note that encrypted sessions are a series of concatenated
`age` output files, one for each batch of messages encrypted for a given
session. Both `sync` and `async` modes try and avoid situations where an
encrypted batch of messages would be split between parts of a multipart upload,
but the auth service should also try and recover in situations where this might
not be the case by splitting on `age` headers. If we mistakenly concatenate
output that was not continuous or part of the same batch, decryption will fail
and we would then be forced to return an error.

![decryption](assets/0127-decryption.png)

### Key Rotation

Rotating keys used for session encryption requires rotating both the `X25519`
keypair used with `age` and the keystore-backed wrapping keys. Because `age`
allows us to encrypt with multiple recipients, all keys can be rotated in a
single action.

When an auth server receives a rotation request, it will:

- Generate a new `X25519` keypair.
- Generate a new `RSA` wrapping keypair using its configured keystore.
- Create a new `WrappedKey` using these keypairs.
- Mark all other active keys for rotation by setting their `State` field to
  `rotating`. This is done in place of removing all other keys in order to
  avoid delays or failures that might come from other auth servers not having
  immediate access to an active `WrappedKey`.
- Replace its own active `WrappedKey` with the newly created one, marking the
  original value's `State` as `rotated`.
- Apply all writes described in a single, atomic write to the backend.

All other auth servers will check if their keys are marked for rotation when a
change to the resource is picked up by their watcher. If they find their keys
need to be rotated, they will essentially repeat the key generation steps:

- Generate a new `RSA` wrapping keypair using their configured keystore
- Push an unfulfilled `WrappedKey` containing the `RSA` keypair and an empty
  `WrappedPrivateKey` to the active keys list.
- Wait for an already rotated auth server to wrap the new `X25519` private key
  with the `RSA` public key included in the unfulfilled `WrappedKey`.
- Confirm the unfulfilled `WrappedKey` is now complete and mark the old
  `WrappedKey.State` as `rotated`.

Once all auth servers have finished rotating their keys, rotation is complete.
Completion is confirmed when the `State` field of all `WrappedKeys` in the
active keys list are set to `active`.

It's worth noting that during the waiting period, the keys scheduled for
rotation are still included as recipients during encryption. Which means
actively rotating auth servers can still easily decrypt session recordings
while waiting for a new `WrappedKey` to be generated.

#### `tctl` Changes

Key rotation will be handled through `tctl` using a new subcommand:

```bash
tctl recordings encryption rotate
```

It will issue a request to the `RotateKeySet` RPC to begin the rotation. The
status of the rotation can be queried with:

```bash
tctl recordings encryption rotate --status
```

This command issues a request to the `GetRotationState` RPC to get the list of
key states for all active keys. Rotation is in progress if at least one key
is marked as `rotating`. It is pending completion when all keys are marked
as `rotated` and complete when all keys are marked as `active`.

### Security

Protection of key material invovled with encrypting session recordings is
largely managed by our existing keystore features. The one exception being the
private keys used by `age` to decrypt files during playback. Whenever possible,
those keys will be wrapped by the backing keystore such that decryption related
secrets are never directly accessible.

One of the primary concerns outside of key management is ensuring that session
recording data is always encrypted before landing on disk or in long term
storage. In order to help enforce this, all session recording interactions
should be gated behind a standard interface that can be implemented as either
plaintext or encrypted. This will help ensure that once the encrypted writer
has been selected, any interactions with session recordings are encrypted by
default.

## UX Examples

For the most part, the user experience of encrypted session recordings is
identical to non-encrypted session recordings. The only notable change is the
addition of the `tctl recordings encryption rotate` subcommand for rotating keys
related to encrypted session recording.

### Teleport admin rotating session recording encryption keys

```bash
tctl recordings encryption rotate
```

### Teleport admin querying status of ongoing rotation

```bash
tctl recordings encryption rotate --status

"Remaining keys to rotate: 3"
```

### Teleport admin replaying encrypted session recording using `tsh`

```bash
tsh play 49608fad-7fe3-44a7-b3b5-fab0e0bd34d1
```

### Teleport admin replaying encrypted session recording file using `tsh`

```bash
tsh play 49608fad-7fe3-44a7-b3b5-fab0e0bd34d1.tar

"Replaying encrypted recording files is not supported by tsh, try replaying the with the session ID instead"
```

### Test Plan

- Sessions are recorded when `auth_service.session_recording.encryption.enabled: on`.
- Encrypted sessions can be played back in both web and `tsh`.
- Encrypted sessions can be recorded and played back with or without a backing
- Key rotations for both key types don't break new recordings or remove the
  ability to decrypt old recordings.
- Repeat all test plan steps with software, HSM, and KMS key backends.

This guide shows you how to configure Teleport to automatically enroll EC2
instances in your cluster, with permissions configured manually.

## Prerequisites

(!docs/pages/includes/edition-prereqs-tabs.mdx!)

- AWS account with EC2 instances and permissions to create and attach IAM
policies.
- EC2 instances running Ubuntu/Debian/RHEL/Amazon Linux 2/Amazon Linux 2023 and SSM agent version 3.1 or greater if making use of the
default Teleport install script. (For other Linux distributions, you can
install Teleport manually.)
- (!docs/pages/includes/tctl.mdx!)

## Step 1/7. Create an EC2 invite token

When discovering EC2 instances, Teleport makes use of IAM invite tokens for
authenticating joining Nodes.

Create a file called `token.yaml`:

```yaml
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  # the token name is not a secret because instances must prove that they are
  # running in your AWS account to use this token
  name: aws-discovery-iam-token
spec:
  # use the minimal set of roles required (e.g. Node, App, Kube, DB, WindowsDesktop)
  roles: [Node]

  # set the join method allowed for this token
  join_method: iam

  allow:
  # specify the AWS account which Nodes may join from
  - aws_account: "123456789"
```

Assign the `aws_account` field to your AWS account number.
Add the token to the Teleport cluster with:

```code
$ tctl create -f token.yaml
```

## Step 2/7. Configure IAM policies

Create the following policy and attach it to the EC2 instance that will run
the Discovery Service:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation",
                "ssm:ListCommandInvocations",
                "ssm:SendCommand"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

All EC2 instances that are to be added to the Teleport cluster by the
Discovery Service must include the `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` IAM policy
in order to receive commands from the Discovery Service.

This policy includes the following permissions:

- `ssm:DescribeAssociation`
- `ssm:GetDeployablePatchSnapshotForInstance`
- `ssm:GetDocument`
- `ssm:DescribeDocument`
- `ssm:GetManifest`
- `ssm:GetParameter`
- `ssm:GetParameters`
- `ssm:ListAssociations`
- `ssm:ListInstanceAssociations`
- `ssm:PutInventory`
- `ssm:PutComplianceItems`
- `ssm:PutConfigurePackageResult`
- `ssm:UpdateAssociationStatus`
- `ssm:UpdateInstanceAssociationStatus`
- `ssm:UpdateInstanceInformation`
- `ssmmessages:CreateControlChannel`
- `ssmmessages:CreateDataChannel`
- `ssmmessages:OpenControlChannel`
- `ssmmessages:OpenDataChannel`
- `ec2messages:AcknowledgeMessage`
- `ec2messages:DeleteMessage`
- `ec2messages:FailMessage`
- `ec2messages:GetEndpoint`
- `ec2messages:GetMessages`
- `ec2messages:SendReply`

## Step 3/7. Create SSM Documents

In each region you plan to discover instances in, create the following SSM document
in the AWS Systems Manager and name it `TeleportDiscoveryInstaller`:

```yaml
schemaVersion: '2.2'
description: aws:runShellScript
parameters:
  token:
    type: String
    description: "(Required) The Teleport invite token to use when joining the cluster."
  scriptName:
    type: String
    description: "(Required) The Teleport installer script to use when joining the cluster."
mainSteps:
- action: aws:downloadContent
  name: downloadContent
  inputs:
    sourceType: "HTTP"
    destinationPath: "/tmp/installTeleport.sh"
    sourceInfo:
      url: "https://<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />/webapi/scripts/installer/{{ scriptName }}"
- action: aws:runShellScript
  name: runShellScript
  inputs:
    timeoutSeconds: '300'
    runCommand:
      - /bin/sh /tmp/installTeleport.sh "{{ token }}"
```

## Step 4/7. Install Teleport on the Discovery Node

<Admonition type="tip">

If you plan on running the Discovery Service on the same Node already running
another Teleport service (Auth or Proxy, for example), you can skip this step.

</Admonition>

Install Teleport on the EC2 instance that will run the Discovery Service:

(!docs/pages/includes/install-linux.mdx!)

## Step 5/7. Configure Teleport to discover EC2 instances

If you are running the Discovery Service on its own host, the service requires a
valid invite token to connect to the cluster. Generate one by running the
following command against your Teleport Auth Service:

```code
$ tctl tokens add --type=discovery
```

Save the generated token in `/tmp/token` on the Node (EC2 instance) that will
run the Discovery Service.

In order to enable EC2 instance discovery the `discovery_service.aws` section
of `teleport.yaml` must include at least one entry:

(!docs/pages/includes/discovery/discovery-group.mdx!)

```yaml
# teleport.yaml
version: v3
teleport:
  join_params:
    token_name: "/tmp/token"
    method: token
  proxy_server: "<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />"
auth_service:
  enabled: false
proxy_service:
  enabled: false
ssh_service:
  enabled: false
discovery_service:
  enabled: true
  discovery_group: "aws-prod"
  aws:
   - types: ["ec2"]
     regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1"]
     tags:
       "env": "prod" # Match EC2 instances where tag:env=prod
     install:
        join_params:
          token_name: aws-discovery-iam-token
          method: iam
      ssm:
        document_name: TeleportDiscoveryInstaller
```

- Edit the `teleport.proxy_server` key to match your Proxy Service's URI
  and port.
- Adjust the keys under `discovery_service.aws` to match your EC2 environment,
  specifically the regions and tags you want to associate with the Discovery
  Service.

## Step 6/7. [Optional] Customize the default installer script

(!docs/pages/includes/server-access/custom-installer.mdx matcher="aws"!)

## Step 7/7. Start Teleport

(!docs/pages/includes/aws-credentials.mdx service="the Discovery Service"!)

(!docs/pages/includes/start-teleport.mdx service="the Discovery Service"!)

Once you have started the Discovery Service, EC2 instances matching the tags you
specified earlier will begin to be added to the Teleport cluster automatically.

## Discovering instances in multiple AWS accounts

To discover EC2 instances in AWS accounts other than the account your Teleport
Discovery Service is running in, Teleport must have permission to assume an IAM
role in each of those accounts. This guide assumes you have finished the main
EC2 discovery guide above and should be repeated for each AWS account you want
to discover instances from.

### Step 1/5. Update EC2 invite token

Add a new entry to `spec.allow` in `token.yaml` and set `aws_account` to the
account number of the new account.

```diff
# token.yaml
kind: token
version: v2
metadata:
  name: aws-discovery-iam-token
spec:
  roles: [Node]
  join_method: iam
  allow:
  - aws_account: "123456789012"
    # Existing entry...
+ - aws_account: "<Var name="destination AWS account ID" />"
```

### Step 2/5. Configure IAM permissions

In the destination account, create a new role and note its ARN. Create the
following IAM policy and attachit to the new role:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ssm:DescribeInstanceInformation",
                "ssm:GetCommandInvocation",
                "ssm:ListCommandInvocations",
                "ssm:SendCommand"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
Edit the trust policy of the new role to allow the Discovery Service
to assume it:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "AWS": "<Var name="discovery service role's ARN" />"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }
    ]
}
```
Create the following policy in the Discovery Service's account and attach it
to the Discovery Service's role:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
            "Resource": "<Var name="new role ARN" />"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Step 3/5. Create SSM Documents

In each region you plan to discover instances in, create the following SSM document
in the AWS Systems Manager and name it `TeleportDiscoveryInstaller`:

```yaml
schemaVersion: '2.2'
description: aws:runShellScript
parameters:
  token:
    type: String
    description: "(Required) The Teleport invite token to use when joining the cluster."
  scriptName:
    type: String
    description: "(Required) The Teleport installer script to use when joining the cluster."
mainSteps:
- action: aws:downloadContent
  name: downloadContent
  inputs:
    sourceType: "HTTP"
    destinationPath: "/tmp/installTeleport.sh"
    sourceInfo:
      url: "https://<Var name="teleport.example.com:443" />/webapi/scripts/installer/{{ scriptName }}"
- action: aws:runShellScript
  name: runShellScript
  inputs:
    timeoutSeconds: '300'
    runCommand:
      - /bin/sh /tmp/installTeleport.sh "{{ token }}"
```

### Step 4/5. Update Teleport configuration

Add an entry to the `discovery_service.aws` section of your `teleport.yaml`
file, assigning <Var name="role ARN" /> to the ARN of the IAM role to assume and
<Var name="optional external ID" /> to an optional external ID:

```yaml
# teleport.yaml
# ...
discovery_service:
  enabled: true
  discovery_group: "aws-prod"
  aws:
  - types: ["ec2"]
    # Add new entry after existing entries
  - types: ["ec2"]
    regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1"]
    install:
      join_params:
        token_name: aws-discovery-iam-token
        method: iam
    tags:
      "env": "prod" # Match EC2 instances where tag:env=prod
    assume_role_arn: "<Var name="role ARN" />"
    external_id: "<Var name="optional external ID" />"
  - types: ["ec2"]
    # Add a new entry for each account.
    # ...
```

### Step 5/5. Restart Teleport

Restart the Teleport service to start discovering new instances:

```code
$ sudo systemd restart teleport
```

You can check the status of the Discovery Service with `systemctl status teleport`
and view its logs with `journalctl -fu teleport`.

## Troubleshooting

If Installs are showing failed or instances are failing to appear check the
Command history in AWS System Manager -> Node Management -> Run Command.
Select the instance-id of the Target to review Errors.

### `cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field`

If you encounter an error similar to the following:

```text
invalid format in plugin properties map[destinationPath:/tmp/installTeleport.sh sourceInfo:map[url:[https://example.teleport.sh:443/webapi/scripts/installer/preprod-installer](https://example.teleport.sh/webapi/scripts/installer/preprod-installer)] sourceType:HTTP];
error json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field DownloadContentPlugin.sourceInfo of type string
```

It is likely that you're running an older SSM agent version. Upgrade to SSM agent version 3.1 or greater to resolve.

### `InvalidInstanceId: Instances [[i-123]] not in a valid state for account 456`

The following problems can cause this error:
- The Discovery Service doesn't have permission to access the managed node.
- AWS Systems Manager Agent (SSM Agent) isn't running. Verify that SSM Agent is running.
- SSM Agent isn't registered with the SSM endpoint. Try reinstalling SSM Agent.
- The discovered instance does not have permission to receive SSM
  commands, verify the instance includes the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore IAM policy.

See SSM RunCommand error codes and troubleshooting information in AWS documentation for more details:
